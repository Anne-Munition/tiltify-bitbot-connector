***
When you run the application, the list of rewards will be retrieved and saved into a file called ``rewards.json`` alongside the executable.

This is to make copying the reward IDs into bit-bot easier and to keep track of which reward is which by the reward name.
They will also be logged to the console window.
 
If you add rewards in the middle of the campaign you will need to restart the application in order to list and see the new IDs.
Otherwise, you can wait until the new reward ID is posted in the commands Twitch chat when the reward is claimed by a new donation.
